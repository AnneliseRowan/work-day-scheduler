# Work-Day-Scheduler

## About
Created a simple day calendar to keep you organized! It is written in military time as I grew up overseas and it makes the most sense to me! I have a function that should clear your local storage everyday at 8am so you can start a new day fresh!

•	Developed a simple day calendar to keep organized. It is written in military to be used internationally. It shows green for the time ahead, red for the current, and grey for the past. You can add different daily tasks and it should recent at the start of a new day. 
•	Used Javascript, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, Local Storage
